# üç∑ Wine Quality Prediction

This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts the quality of wine based on its physicochemical properties. It leverages a dataset of red wine samples and uses various machine learning algorithms to classify wine quality.


## üìä Dataset

- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository ‚Äì Wine Quality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality)
- **Description**: Contains physicochemical test results for red wine samples, including:
  - Fixed acidity
  - Volatile acidity
  - Citric acid
  - Residual sugar
  - Chlorides
  - Free sulfur dioxide
  - Total sulfur dioxide
  - Density
  - pH
  - Sulphates
  - Alcohol
  - Quality (target label)

## üß† Model Used

- Logistic Regression


## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow

1. Data Loading
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Data Preprocessing
4. Feature Scaling
